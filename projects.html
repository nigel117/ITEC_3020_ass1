                <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Python was my very first coding language from when I was in high school and I have loved ever since! 
                This specific project is a card game in which the player is given 100 points and then presented with a playing card,
                the player must then guess whether the next card shown will have a higher or lower value than the first card, they must bet 
                from 1 to 100 points on their guess. The game continues till either the player gambles all of their money away and therefore loses, or they succesfully
                gain 500 or more points within 10 rounds, if they do, they win! Feel free to inpect the game code further by clicking the "View Project Code" button. </p>

                <p style="font-size: 20px;">I have been coding with Java since my first year at York and there were many projects I could includ here. 
                    I chose this project in particular becasue it demonstrates my ability to code using typical Java capabilities as well as Java GUIs. Although it is a simple
                    game the code is actually quite elaborate, in all, I am immensely proud of this project, and although Java is not my go to language, I still
                    know my way around! If you would like to view the project code more in depth you can hit the "View Project Code" button to take a closer look.</p>
